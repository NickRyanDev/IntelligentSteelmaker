This system could be a base for another systens to use IoT in their processes.

How it works? 

It's simple, one sensor reads one temperature information and reports to another (arduino) machine in another area to actuate the cooling system, and then a sensor, to, inform back if it is working. This system guarantees corrections of refrigerators and procedure in the metal manufacturer.
